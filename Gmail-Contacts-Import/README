### GMAIL CONTACTS MUNGER

N.B. Use at your own risk. Backups are your friend!

### USAGE

cards2gmail.php -f input_filename [-v] [-o output_filename]

-f input filename, see below on the format for this file
-v verbose, display dump of any errors
-o specify output filename, defaults to: gmail-import.csv

Requirements: PHP 5.1 or greater and command-line PHP

Importing the contacts should create a new group in Gmail, labelled with the
date the import was made. This means it's easy to delete the contacts if it
goes wrong. 

But I can't stress this enough:

BACKUPS ARE YOUR FRIEND!

Take a backup before you start playing. Just think how long it took to put
together all of those contacts eh?!

### CREATING CSV INPUT FILE

You can make a copy of the Google Spreadsheet, save a copy with your contacts
added then feed it to the script:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmLbS8Gq5NUHdDZpWlRfMnF0NWdLSjdzN1hxWU40Q1E

Or you can roll your own CSV with the following headings - they're all 
optional, but Gmail might not work if you're missing too many of the key ones:

Name
Work Email
Company
Job Title
Work Phone
Mobile Phone
Street
City
Region
Postal Code
Country
Group Membership
Notes
Work Website
Skype
Twitter

### BACKGROUND

This is a very simple PHP script that was put together to try and simplify the
process of manually adding lots of business cards to Gmail Contacts. I found
that the web interface was very slow and involved lots of clicking around.

The basic info on the Gmail website only allows the additional of very basic
information and offended by organisational OCD by putting data in the wrong
places. You can find the info here, if you're interested:

It's not very helpful. To get an idea of how Gmail organises it contacts, I
exported a really detailed contact in their native CSV format.

The hope was that it'd be quicker to whip through a spreadsheet of contact
details in the native format and upload it. Sadly, it's complicated and doesn't
lend itself to speedy data-entry.

The script uses a very simple spreadsheet that should be very quick to fill out
with understandable headings. This gets saved into a CSV format and fed to the
script which'll make some assumptions, check some values and spit out a CSV
format that can be imported using Gmail Contacts standard function.

I hope it's useful. Feel free to tinker/change/update, there's enormous room
for improvement.
